The sum is greater than the parts. This effect plugin is a combination of our 3Q and FLANGR plugins for some triple band flanging action.

Just like 3Q the mid frequency can be adjusted and each band can be deactivated by setting the amount to full left. Just like FLANGR the LFO speed range goes from 0 up to 20Hz and feedback can modulate between positive and negative flanging.

Like all our other software this plugin is without DRM and Opensource.
